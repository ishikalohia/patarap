# Ishika's application to the Upptime GitHub Externship

Hello, world! My name is Ishika and I want to apply to this externship because the knowledge and experience I will gain from this project will help me a lot in my future ahead. Being an aspiring software developer, I would like to work on future technologies. I have experience of working on technogies like Node.js, React.js, MongoDB, CSS, HTML, JavaScript. I have worked on 10+ personal and group project based on MERN Stack. Now, I want to implement these skills on an open-source project which will be helpful for thousands of people. <br>
The project Upptime has a huge growth potential. I beleive that uptime website monitoring is very important for every business. Website downtime can have a very bad impact on company's revenue, user's experience and it's overall growth. So, Upptime can be a saviour at that time and businesses would be interested in Upptime. So, this project is very useful and can be a huge success in coming future. 

<h4> Ideas for Upptime, contribution Strategy & time commitment </h4>

Upptime checks the site-avalibility continously, provides incident reports, response time graph, status website. It will be great, if we can have a Real-time user monitoring facility. To know how the web-app is performing and interacting with the users. SSL testing can be included as well to receive alerts in case of invalid and expiring soon certificate. It will be great if there can be option to customize graph like adding description etc. We can include og (open graph) tags. Issues detection can be made more specific which will be helpful in resolution of issue faster. There are some ideas in the discussion section which I think can be a great additon like support of gitlab CLI and pipelines scheduling, use of XPath for more specific use-case. 
<br>
During my contribution period, I would like to first resolve and work on the existing bugs. Then I would like to work the features already avaliable to make them better like adding og tag to customize the graphs etc and then will focus on the new features. 
<br>
If I am selected, I shall be able to work around 30 hrs a week on the project, though I am open to putting in more effort if the work requires.
